                                                 Assignment 1.5

1.Hadoop in layman's term:
        Hadoop is a framework that is used in storing very very large amounts of data(either structured or unstructured) and using that data in making efficient 
        decisions in future.
        It uses HDFS (for storing), MAP REDUCE(for processing).


2. Components of Hadoop framework
            1.HDFS(Hadoop File System):  Used to store very large amount of data.Just like a database.
            2.Map Reduce:  Used for processing such huge data and produce results that help in decision-making.


3.Reasons to learn Big data technologies
        1. Data keeps increasing day by day . Such huge data has to be stored and processed in a proper and a quick way.
            This technology helps in properly maintaining that data.
        2. Demand for Big Data skills as well as the pay is extremely high.
